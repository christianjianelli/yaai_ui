## Quickstart

### Running Your First ABAP AI Chat

This quickstart example demonstrates how to launch a simple AI-powered chat interface in ABAP using the `yaai_ui` library. 
The provided code sets up a basic report that initializes the chat UI, connects to an AI model (such as OpenAI's GPT), and displays a user-friendly chat window. 
Make sure your API credentials and endpoints are configured before running the example.
